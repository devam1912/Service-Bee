# 🐝🎃 Service Bee – Backend

Service Bee is a **production-grade MERN backend** for **local service discovery, smart service booking, and real-time communication** between users and verified service providers.

It follows **industry-grade backend architecture** with authentication, role-based access, admin moderation, and real-time features — layered with a **subtle Halloween / spooky theme** for presentation only.

> 👻 Serious backend. Spooky vibes.

## 🧠 Core Idea

- Users raise service requests  
- Companies accept and complete them  
- Admins verify and control trust  
- Real-time chat enables instant communication  
- Spooky status labels enhance UX (presentation-only)

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access (`user`, `company`, `admin`)
- Protected routes via middleware
- Separate login flows for users, companies, and admin

---
### 🧠 Smart Availability Engine (Bonus Feature)

Service Bee includes an intelligent booking system that prevents overbooking and adds automatic slot management.

#### 🔮 How It Works

• Companies define working days and daily slot capacity  
• Users must select a booking date  
• Backend validates day availability  
• Slots auto-lock when booked  
• Pending requests auto-expire after 30 minutes  
• Expired requests automatically free slots  

This makes the booking system **self-healing, overbooking-proof, and production-ready.**

### 👁️ Paranormal Trust Score (Ranking System)

Service Bee includes a spooky-themed ranking engine that automatically ranks companies based on service quality and reliability.

**Trust Score Formula:**

trustScore = (averageRating × 20) + completedRequests − (rejectedRequests × 5)

The formula ensures reliable providers rise and poor performers automatically sink.

**Aura Levels**
| Trust Score | Aura |
|------------|------|
| 0–19 | 🕸️ Cursed |
| 20–49 | 🧟 Haunted |
| 50–79 | 🧛 Possessed |
| 80+ | 👁️ Ascended |

Companies are automatically sorted by trust score in the public marketplace.
---
### 📅 Service Requests (Booking System)
- Users create service requests for companies
- Request lifecycle:
  - `pending` → `accepted` → `completed`
  - `rejected`
- Duplicate active requests prevented
- Companies manage only their own requests
- Requests locked after completion

Spooky aliases:
- `pending` → 👻 Haunting  
- `accepted` → 🧛 Possessed  
- `completed` → 🪦 Exorcised  

---

### 💬 Real-Time Communication
- Socket.IO powered real-time chat
- Request-based private rooms
- JWT-authenticated sockets
- Chat disabled after request completion
- Messages persisted in MongoDB

---

### 📎 Attachments & Media
- Image uploads with service requests
- Multer for multipart parsing
- Cloudinary for cloud storage
- Secure URLs stored in MongoDB
